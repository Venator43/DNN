# DNN
DNN Is Short For Dummy Neural Network.

This model is made solely for educational purpose and to better understand the inner gear of a neural network and not for something that would be used to replace a library like tensorflow or made into any full program

# Usefull function

MLP(input_layer, [hidden_layer], output_layer)

use to declare the neural network

the parameter used to declare how much node each layer would have

MLP.fit(X,y,epoch,learning_rate)

Use to train the network

X is the input node

y is the expected output node of X

epoch is how many cycle you want the neural network to train

learning_rate is how much the rate of decent you want for the weight

MLP.forward(X)

Use to predict trained network

X is the input for the input layer
